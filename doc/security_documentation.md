# Security Documentation

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the security measures implemented in the Advanced Custom PC Building Module for Odoo V16 CE.

## Secure Component Selection and Configuration

The module implements secure component selection and configuration. This is achieved by validating user inputs and sanitizing them to prevent SQL injection attacks. The validation and sanitization processes are implemented in the `select_component` and `configure_component` functions in the `controllers/main.py` file.

## Protection Against Web Vulnerabilities

The system is designed to protect against common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). This is achieved by using parameterized queries and prepared statements in the database interactions, and by encoding user inputs before they are displayed on the web pages.

## HTTPS for Secure Communication

The system uses HTTPS for secure communication between the client and the server. This ensures that the data transmitted between the client and the server is encrypted and cannot be intercepted by attackers.

## Access Rights

The module implements access rights to control what actions users can perform. Access rights are defined as records of the model `ir.model.access` in the `security/ir.model.access.csv` file. Each access right is associated with a model, a group (or no group for global access), and a set of permissions: read, write, create, unlink.

## Conclusion

Security is a critical aspect of the Advanced Custom PC Building Module. By implementing secure component selection and configuration, protecting against common web vulnerabilities, using HTTPS for secure communication, and implementing access rights, the module ensures that users can build custom PCs on the e-commerce website securely.
